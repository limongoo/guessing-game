    <h4>&mdash;Here's a little bit more about me, the text is from the Class 1 homework.</h4>
    <p>My name is Ivan Limongan, I was born in Indonesia but grew up in Portland. I've been here in Portland most of my life, so I definitely feel like a Portlander. Some thing my favorite things to do is designing thing in general both in print and web design. I love food a lot and love all the foodcarts that are in town. My goal in 5 years is to visit half of all the food carts in Portland, while keeping my current weight also.  </p>
    <p>I'm super excited to taking the Code Fellows 201 class, I really look forward to end up learing front-end development. I love the process of planning a website, going through the user experience process and developing the site. I hope to learn more JavaScript so I can make better and more cooler looking sites. Someday, I want to work in dream job at <strong>INSTRUMENT</strong> in North Portland, they make the coolest websites in the industry. </p>
